I was so high before you spoke
You pulled me in, fixed what was broke
Said all the right things, like some kind of magic
But now it feels tragic
It all starts like this, can't get you off my mind
I can't admit, that I knew the entire time
We go in circles, 'til somebody breaks
I'm gonna make you, my last mistake
